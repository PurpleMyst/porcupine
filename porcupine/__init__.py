"""
Porcupine is a simple, beginner-friendly editor for writing Python code.
If you ever used anything like Notepad, Microsoft Word or LibreOffice
Writer before, you will feel right at home.

You can create a new file by pressing Ctrl+N or open an existing file by
pressing Ctrl+O. The file name will be displayed in red if the file has
been changed and you can save the file with Ctrl+S. Then you can run the
file by pressing F5.

See the menus at the top of the editor for other things you can do and
their keyboard shortcuts.
